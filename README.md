**Presentation**

Extractify is a free extension for Chrome, developed in JavaScript under Bracket, whose purpose is to scrap structured data on the web. It is particularly designed for collecting online comments or online conversations such as forums.

It allows you to: 
1) Select structured information on a web page (like tables with rows and columns), by direct selection on the web page, or manual selection by entering HTML tags and related CSS code
2) Select the pagination of pages with the same structure and level
3) Repeat the process as many times as desired for lower levels
4) Scrape the whole selection
5) Finally, obtain a file in json format that can be easily imported in other software, [in L@ME for example](https://github.com/fredericvergnaud/lame).

What it does not allow: everything else!
